# Comparasion of CNN v/s Tranformer application in Facial Recognition

This project has an aim of developing a source code to Recognize faces using the CNN approach as well as Transformer approach and them comparing both
of them based on their results.

## Dataset 

Labeled faces in the wild worlds

Labeled Faces in the Wild is a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching. No matter what the performance of an algorithm on
LFW, it should not be used to conclude that an algorithm is suitable for any commercial purpose. There are many reasons for this. Here is a 
non-exhaustive list:

Face verification and other forms of face recognition are very different problems. For example, it is very difficult to extrapolate from performance on
verification to performance on 1:N recognition.
Many groups are not well represented in LFW. For example, there are very few children, no babies, very few people over the age of 80, and a relatively 
small proportion of women. In addition, many ethnicities have very minor representation or none at all.
While theoretically LFW could be used to assess performance for certain subgroups, the database was not designed to have enough data for strong 
statistical conclusions about subgroups. Simply put, LFW is not large enough to provide evidence that a particular piece of software has been thoroughly 
tested.
Additional conditions, such as poor lighting, extreme pose, strong occlusions, low resolution, and other important factors do not constitute a major part 
of LFW. These are important areas of evaluation, especially for algorithms designed to recognize images “in the wild”.

For all of these reasons, we would like to emphasize that LFW was published to help the research community make advances in face verification, not to 
provide a thorough vetting of commercial algorithms before deployment.

While there are many resources available for assessing face recognition algorithms, such as the Face Recognition Vendor Tests run by the USA National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the understanding of how to best test face recognition algorithms for commercial use is a rapidly evolving 
area. Some of us are actively involved in developing these new standards, and will continue to make them publicly available when they are ready.
